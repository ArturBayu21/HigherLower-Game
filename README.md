art folder is where i store the ASCII art logo
Game data is a folder that store the the subject data for the comparison.

How does the program work:
Once you run the program, it will choose 2 random subjects from the game data folder. Those 2 random subject will be compared by the computer, and the computer will ask you as the user to pick which one is more popular (has more instagram follower) from booth of the subject. If you guess it right, you get one score, and the computer continue comparing the subject that you guess with another subject that the computer pick randommly. Other wise, if you guess it wrong, you will get an output that says game over, and the program ends.
